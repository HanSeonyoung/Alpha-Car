# Alpha-Car

This is an autonomous RC car project.
We applied object detection using Deep Learning YOLO v2 Network and lane detection using OpenCV.

In addition, we used rasberry pie in RC car to use ultrasonic sensor and RFID.
The ultrasonic sensor recognizes obstacles that the camera can not see and RFID recognizes bus stops.
